# CTF Writeups

Hey! This is a collection of writeups I've written as part of my hobby. I first started participating in local CTF events in 2021; however, after several competitions, I took a break to focus on school. In the second half of 2025, I decided to return to my hobby and created this repository. My aim is to build a personal digital library of my work, but I hope others will benefit from these writeups as well. Since I am from Romania, this repository may also contain writeups in Romanian. 

## Which competitions do these writeups cover? 

First of all, I decided to start with **picoCTF** because it's a more beginner-friendly platform than others I have tried. I also plan to start doing writeups for **UNBreakable**, **TryHackMe**, **ROCSC** and others.

## Repository structure

The writeups are organized by Platform and by Challenge Name. As I solve more challenges, I plan to reorganize them by Category.
